# Data-Analytics---Project-1
TPSS Data Analytics Boot Camp Spring 2019

Project Prompt -- "Explore the data for the DC_Properties.csv dataset. Begin to prepare the data 
(clean, manipulate, transform, etc.) for future analysis. What interesting things can you conclude about the data?"

NOTES ON WHAT TO ADD/MANIPULATE/CALCULATE:
- Compare how many properties of each type sold
- Find price per square foot
- Average (or median?) price per type of house
- Average (or median?) value for each quadrant & ward
- Sale price by AYB, remodel date
- Remove all rows with blank cells

Per TripSavvy: "The median price in a particular neighborhood is generally regarded as the more useful of these two ways of looking at prices. That's because an average price can be significantly skewed by sales that are extremely high or extremely low."
